      <description>Pug Facts From Wikipedia:
The pug is a breed of dog with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body with well-developed muscles.
Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rico absolutely loves to eat.  Some of his favorite snacks include lettuce, pizza, baby carrots, slices of deli turkey and of course BACON!  His daily kibble is &lt;a href=&#34;https://bluebuffalo.com/dry-dog-food/life-protection-formula/lamb-brown-rice-recipe/&#34;&gt;Blue Buffalo Lamb and Rice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rico&amp;rsquo;s diet was very easy to figure out after clearing up many of his allergies.  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://bluebuffalo.com/&#34;&gt;Blue Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; brand of food really was a great help in determining&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago my wife Betsy and I had a pug named Charlie.  Charlie had grown ill and we felt it was time for him to have a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That friend was Rico.  Rico&amp;rsquo;s story is that of triumph when no one had time to care for him.  We adopted him at the right time in his life to provide him with the love and care he deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rescuing a dog is one of the best thing&amp;rsquo;s we&amp;rsquo;ve ever done.  We have given Rico a wonderful life, we hope to continue to for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
