        "body": "Several years ago my wife Betsy and I had a pug named Charlie. Charlie had grown ill and we felt it was time for him to have a friend.\nThat friend was Rico. Rico\u0026rsquo;s story is that of triumph when no one had time to care for him. We adopted him at the right time in his life to provide him with the love and care he deserves.\nRescuing a dog is one of the best thing\u0026rsquo;s we\u0026rsquo;ve ever done. We have given Rico a wonderful life, we hope to continue to for many years.\n Rico is an amazing pug, here\u0026rsquo;s a fact sheet about him!\n Name: Rico Breed: Pug Home town: New York City Age: 13 Birthday: 12/11/2006 Gotcha day: 1/16/2015 Color: fawn Nicknames: Sweet Baby Rico, Baby Man, Baby Dude Favorite baseball team: Yankees   \r## Rico is a dancer\r   View this post on Instagram        Today‚Äôs #moshwithyourpetschallenge is ‚Äùclobberin‚Äô time‚Äù by @sickofitallnyc - @teacha_krsone Rico was super annoyed and got a cookie for his mosh enthusiasm #nyhc #nyc #queens #krs1 #pug #pugs #pugsofinstagram #dog #dogs #mosh #punkhardcore #hardcore #soia #sickofitall #sickofitallnyc #sickofitallnyhc\nA post shared by Jay (@jaydestro) on Apr 18, 2020 at 7:45am PDT\n   Rico loves the sun!
