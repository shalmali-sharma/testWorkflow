Several years ago my wife Betsy and I had a pug named Charlie.  Charlie had grown ill and we felt it was time for him to have a friend.

That friend was Rico.  Rico's story is that of triumph when no one had time to care for him.  We adopted him at the right time in his life to provide him with the love and care he deserves.

Rescuing a dog is one of the best thing's we've ever done.  We have given Rico a wonderful life, we hope to continue to for many years.
